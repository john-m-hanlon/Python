Introduction to Algorithmic Trading
- leverage lessons: https://www.quantopian.com/learn
- algor = defined set of rules
- i.e. 50% allo to equities (S&P500) 10& (bond index), when DAX > .5, close move to cash
- used for risk management, when something triggers a touch point move everything to cash
- rebalance once a month
- can issue buy/sell orders at any point thoughtout 24 hrs, would be able to make orders overnight, i.e.
- reduce risk
- human traders w cog bias, small universe of securities
- look up israeli court, statistically more sig case of acquital after lunch, 12p, more likely later in day..analogy is human trader working at 2p v 4p
- algo helps to include biases into the rules, but can mitigate the human element
- backteseting: runnning algo through historial performance, to see how it might have performed
- quantopian updates data on a minute basis, i.e. won't reflect 12:01:05
- backtesting allows you test historical scenarios

	- include these time frames for indexing performance
	- scenario analysis (down markets, up markets)
- survival bias, how can you before that it isn't random luck that somebody performanced well

- need to use as many tools as possible to be able to validate algo
- need to include delisted companies in screener, source of bias
- correction bias, needs to know when data has been corrected, i.e. datasets will release only corrected data, so if there is a data error, i.e. apple = 1,000.00/shs and you sell, they release correction of aapl = 100.00/shs, you may lose money due to correction and cost basis, need to understand there is inherent bias with datasets

- backtest in the 90s, is not indicative of how trading occurs today

- quantopian currently only has us equities 930a-4p
- futures next, need to add Fixed Income as well as mkt open & mkt close


12:00pm - 12:30pm
Overview of Quantopian Platform
- Forums have a huge amount of survival bias on trading forums



12:30pm - 1:00pm
Introduction to the Research Environment

- need to normally distribute data, bad practice, tough to trust statistics when underlying data is not normalized
- pretty much nothing is normally distributed


1:00pm - 1:30pm
Lecture: Pairs Trading Strategy
- take something and change a little piece, tweak it a bit and see what changes, work with the data and ask why it may or may not work
- okay to randomized data from a normalized dataset for learning purposes, but might not be indicative of real life scenarios
- pvalues should be binary, either stat sig or not stat sig
- mean reversion, if the correlation betweenn the two is especially large then they are going to move together, short the higher, long the lower
- if the two are closer together the long the first and short the second, as long as the difference moves closer or farther apart should make a profit on the long short strategy \
- if they diverge then you lose money
- use math to gain an understanding of how a system works then make a targets bet
- minimize risk of other tagalong bets associated with the order & execution 
- long in one, short in the other // need to do a regression to understand how to weight, a linear regresssion on the time series
- need to copute the 'hedge ratio'
- pairs trading is just price history
- top quants now include fundamentals in their algorithms

- mutliple comparissons bias, if you run a bunch of pvalue tests, just give a probabily, confidence, not perfect
- what is the prob that if there no relationship in your data that youg et a pvalue below 5%? 5%
- need a second stage validation if you are doing a cross-sectional analysis

- come up with candidates with things that should be cointegrated, which make economic sense, instruments that should track each other, a future and an underlying equity

- paris trading takes advantage of when these things do not track each other
- do regression  / correlation analysis

- confounding variable bias, looks like relationship between A and B, but it is really C that causes them to move, happens with cointegrated, the market or sector may just push them around, probably want to include a sector index to see if it was a confounding variable...could make var non-market neutral

- use to convince you are wrong
- use numbers and statistical tests confirm theories

- danger case, convince yourself you're right when you're wrong, make a bet
- base case
- safe, dont make a bet

- look ahead bias

- use z-score, may allow you to decide when to go long/short in pair trading strategy
- need to do analysis on predictive power,

- be aware of where cointegration comes, need to know if it is the market which is driving in reality...i.e: stark increase in DJI or SP500, may 






1:30pm - 2:00pm
Exercise: Find Your Own Pairs

2:00pm - 2:30pm
Exercise: Backtesting
- backtesting is a simulation of a state of the world
- incorporate rebalancing
-- come up with hypothesis of how the world works
-- use statisicall analysis to verify hypothesis
-- put in a backtest to show how it actually works in real life



2:30pm - 3:00pm
Lecture: Overfitting

3:30pm - 5:30pm
Exercise: Design Your Own Strategy

5:30pm - 6:00pm
