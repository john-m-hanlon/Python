Compare calculated values v provided
Create toggle for add-backs i.e. (Should any addbacks be y/n, if y then show a list of the potential fields, then allow the user to add specified value with a comment of where it was found, there will be a comment section on the back where this will be put, only if the addbacks are present, the addback value with be a variable incorporated into the normalized value, so when it is n = 0, when it is y = rawData)

create toggle for gordon growth v terminal multiple

create toggle for calculated v called data fields i.e. free cash flow

look into creating a SQL server database to allow for pulling data easier without ruining daily call limits

might not be a bad idea to use this to create a blog, show positions taken, publish feedback, get feedback, won't ruin anything, not really hiding anything compared to inst. guys

need to ensure authenticity of data

could be 1200-2400 a year for basic fundamental data, cogs



Questions for quandl/database:

	⁃	what is the most DL database
	⁃	What is the largest data base of securities
	⁃	How many metrics does each contain
	⁃	Are these uniform throughout 
	⁃	How often it updated 
	⁃	Where do you get your estimates from
	⁃	How many calls/day
	⁃	Is each metric a unique call count
	⁃	Is there a trial version of your dataset
	⁃	Why your dataset v competitor
	⁃	Do you charge monthly v quarterly
	⁃	Do all levels of subscription receive equal service / support?
	⁃	Do you house economic data as well, just securities?
	⁃	Equity & ficc?
	⁃	Do you provide realtime or historical prices / data?

Questions for screener strat:
	⁃	follow sentdex tutorial, wil have high growth companies
	⁃	Mess with metrics and cut offs to screen for stable high growth (look for acronym)
	⁃	Need screener to sent: name, ticker, current price, market cap, P/E ratio, industry
	⁃	Need an index of each ticker, and their industry to create index
	⁃	Need to find a way to curate tailored peer group, need to see if this data is provided or needs to be manipulated
	⁃	Need to save this data to a txt file so that the trading model and pull from it....need to run screener, populate txt files, valuation model will pull from this txt to say where each security is valued relative to current share price, will produce txt with ticker, industry, name, current price, Val price, tev, Val tev, in addition to Val screener is the actual Val charting, this will show comps, TA indicators, visually represent the security, 
	⁃	Trading algo will use the valuation metrics in terms of when to close positions, will use 3 indicators, Sma, macd, rsi, to determine entry and exit points 
	⁃	Trading algo needed to be more sophisticated, work on developing this

	⁃	Moving forward incorporate: 
	⁃	volatility, sp for benchmark, probability for rate hikes, djia


Questions for valuation strat:
	⁃	correlation between us GDP, global GDP, industry GDP, industry index, and revenue? How do we get a stable rev growth rate?
	⁃	Need table of metrics to show change yoy, will show extra-ordinary initiatives / projects i.e. Capex -- this will help us get line items as a % of rev and get us to ufcf 
	⁃	Now determine wacc:
	⁃	Need peer group, cap structure, betas, sp data, 10yr tbill 
	⁃	Need to define peer group
	⁃	Need assumed valuation date w 10-k/q report data
	⁃	Define terminal value, need peer group comps to get ebitda multiple
	⁃	Gordon growth, need to do 2-5% (figure out a method for this toggle)
	⁃	Discount ufcf back to present, add to terminal value
	⁃	Divide by shs outstanding to get share price and compare against current price -- integrate this into the trading model, will set a ceiling or floor --
	⁃	
	⁃	
	⁃	


To do:
List all the variables and create checklist
Will need to attack each one by one and have an excel sheet tracking this progress
Develop a test script for scenarios
Develop HLD, review baml hlds
Write sla, see if this is covered by quandl database
Create workflows to show how data is transitioned throughout the application and where it is pulled from
**Read II, finish dma**
Look into Ib and Rh -- can I do either @baml or need to move?
Leverage quantopian back testing (maybe)

Three indicators def simplistic, but need to create some kind of backtesting model to feasbility of the project
- use the screener to source a list of potential companies
- do some analysis to see which are in a target range
- use TA chart to show if possible to get returns, and if so, how much
- need a backtest to say if we had 50k, can we make money, no invesetment over 10k, lets say 50k across 5 diversified equities
- bring FICC into it later
- just want to see how it plays out, dont necessarily trust quantopian's backtest, can calculate on our own

- we can do this in excel to expedite the process, need yahoo intraday data to say if we trade during the day
- need different columns that say all three agree, long at current price, x = trade cost, once one goes against, close at the current price, x = trade cost....final - initial - x = gains(loss)...aggregate this data,
